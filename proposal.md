# Major Project Proposal

## Description
With my major project, I intend to advance my understanding of game development regarding OOP, engine behaviour, modules, physics and much more. I'm going to use HTML 5 Canvas to create my project with the intent of making an easy-to-play multiplayer 2D shooter. I want snappy controls (high acceleration and deceleration) and precise air controls. It won't be top-down but rather a platformer. I want to add a twist to set apart my game from something basic. I'm taking inspiration from the VALVE portal series in having a main movement mechanic being portals. Once placed, these portals will allow players to shoot and travel through them. I'm intending to implement a round system with a basic economy.
