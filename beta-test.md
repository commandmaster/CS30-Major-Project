# CS - Feedback
- There is some sort of bug where you will fall super quickly when stepping off a platform.
- There is a movement glitch where if you are holding a sideways movement key and quickly press and hold the opposite direction, you fill freeze for a small amount of time.
- The animations look good and the shooting is well made, but the game is missing a bit of pzazz. 

# Normal Person - Feedback
- No sound effects made the game feel incomplete.
- I was a little confused when at the start as what to do.
- The platforms felt slippery and the player was a little bit hard to control.
- Once I stated to get the hang of the game, I found myself having more fun.
