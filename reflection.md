# Reflection

## What advice would I give to myself if I were to start this project again?
- I would tell myself to focus on building key features of the product I want to build and not to worry about perfection. I would have scrapped the multiplayer idea in favour of a simpler single-player game with a better player experience. I would have moved some more needs-to-have features into the nice-to-have section to relieve some of the restrictions
I set upon myself.
- Spend more time intentionally thinking through each aspect of the game before attempting to code it. 
- Avoid preemptive abstraction in favour of a concrete solution. In many of the problems that I had, it would've been a better idea to create something and refactor it later. Doing this
could have removed some unnecessary complexity.
- Don't bite off more than you can chew. I spent a large portion of my time creating features such as physics, rendering and game engine creation; this time may have been better spent
developing key gameplay features. With that being said, I very much enjoyed the process of creating a physics engine and the tileable map editor.

## Did I complete everything in my "needs to have" list?
- I did not complete everything in my needs-to-have section. About one week before the deadline, I was completely unable to make any progress in the networking of my game.
With countless known and unknown bugs, I completely pivoted my multiplayer fighting game to a single-player parkour platformer. In doing this the needs-to-have for the project changed drastically.
- I may not have completed the original needs-to-have, but I still managed to create a game with lots of cool features, ending up with a codebase of over 5400 lines of code.
- I did my best to hit some of the needs-to-have from the other project by incorporating them in the new game, in particular the gun system.
  
## What was the hardest part of the project?
- The hardest part of the project was creating the networking framework and architecture. This was something I ultimately could not accomplish in the allotted time frame.
- A close second for the hardest part of the project was creating the physics engine. In the end, I did manage to finish the engine.

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- I couldn't get multiplayer to work.

## Things about my project that I'm proud of
- I'm proud of the physics engine.
- The tile editor.
- I created the game and managed to finish it in a week.
- That I didn't use any libraries and instead only used vanilla javascript.
- The scriptable engine architecture that allowed me to build up the game in the time I did.
